Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The function sum2DArray is called with array2D, logging "Sum called ...".
It then checks if the array is empty. Since array2D is not empty, it proceeds without rejecting.
The message "returning from sum" is logged because the function reaches the end of its synchronous execution before the setTimeout starts.
sumPromise1 is logged as a pending promise.
The function sum2DArray is then called with an empty array, logging "Sum called ...".
It checks if the array is empty and, since it is, immediately rejects the promise with the message "Cannot sum an empty array".
The message "returning from sum" is logged again, similar to the first call, as the function finishes its synchronous execution.
sumPromise2 is logged as a rejected promise.
After the 0ms setTimeout, the function starts summing array2D for sumPromise1. It logs each element as it's added to the sum: "Adding 1 to sum", "Adding 2 to sum", etc., until the sum of 45 is calculated.
The promise resolves with 45, and sumPromise1.then logs 45.
For sumPromise2, since it was rejected earlier, sumPromise2.catch logs "Cannot sum an empty array".
